(a) Blood donation is a totally voluntary act and no inducement or remuneration has been offered
<br>
(b) Donation of blood/components is a medical procedure and that by donating voluntarily. I accept
the risk associated with this procedure

(c) My donated blood, blood and plasma recovered from my donated blood may be sent for plasma
fractionation for preparation of plasma derived medicinal products, all of which may be used for
larger patient population and not just this blood bank.
