        <p>Blood donation is a simple and safe way to save lives. Your donation can help accident victims, surgery
            patients, and those with serious illnesses, as blood cannot be manufactured and relies entirely on
            donors like you. The process takes about 10 minutes and uses sterile, disposable equipment, with
            minimal discomfort. After donating, you’ll receive refreshments and should rest for a few minutes.
            <br>
            <br>
            To donate, you must be in good health, between 18-65 years old, and weigh over 50 kg. Donating blood
            helps maintain healthy iron levels, and each donation can save up to three lives. Side effects like mild
            dizziness or bruising are rare and usually pass quickly with rest and hydration.
            <br>
            <br>
            While blood donation is safe, some donors may experience minor side effects like dizziness or slight
            bruising, which usually go away quickly with rest and hydration. We recommend avoiding heavy physical
            activity for 24 hours after donating and drinking plenty of fluids to help your body recover.
            <br>
            <br>
            By donating regularly, you provide a critical resource that helps your community. A single donation can
            make a world of difference—be a part of the life-saving effort today!</p>
